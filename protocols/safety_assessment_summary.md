# Safety Assessment Summary (Pilot Studies)

## Objective
To evaluate potential acute toxicity and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) from the TIRA vector platform in murine models.

## Studies Conducted

### 1. Acute Toxicity (Single High Dose)
- **Model:** Healthy C57BL/6 mice (n=5).
- **Dose:** 2e9 vp (4x therapeutic dose) via intradermal injection.
- **Monitoring:** 14 days (weight, activity, clinical signs).
- **Results:** No mortality, no significant weight loss (>5%), no visible distress. Mild local inflammation resolved by day 5.

### 2. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) Profile
- **Model:** MC38 tumor-bearing mice after TIRA administration.
- **Method:** Serum cytokine multiplex at 6h, 24h, 72h, 168h.
- **Findings:**
  - Expected elevation of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2 (peaked at 24-72h, within manageable range).
  - No dangerous spike in IL-6 (>500 pg/ml is concern threshold; observed max 95 pg/ml).
  - No significant elevation of IL-1β or GM-CSF.

### 3. Off-Target Autoimmunity Screen
- **Tissue Panel:** Liver, lung, intestine, skin collected at endpoint.
- **Analysis:** H&E staining for immune infiltration.
- **Result:** No evidence of lymphocytic infiltration or tissue damage beyond baseline in age-matched controls. No clinical signs of autoimmunity (coat, behavior, weight).

### 4. Vector Biodistribution (qPCR)
- **Tissues Tested:** Blood, liver, spleen, lung, gonads, brain.
- **Time Points:** 3 days and 21 days post-injection.
- **Finding:** Vector DNA detected primarily at injection site and draining lymph nodes. Low-level signal in liver (<0.1% of total). Cleared from blood by day 7. No detection in gonads or brain.

## Preliminary Conclusion
In these controlled murine studies, the TIRA platform showed a favorable safety profile with no evidence of acute toxicity, severe cytokine storm, or autoimmunity. **This is not predictive of human safety.** A comprehensive GLP toxicology study in a relevant species is an absolute prerequisite for any clinical consideration.
