# Concept: Targeted Immune Recognition Amplification (TIRA)

## The Problem

The immune system can recognize cancer, but its response is often too narrow, too slow, or gets suppressed. Checkpoint inhibitors help "release the brakes," but they don't "teach" the immune system to see more targets. We wondered: what if we could directly guide the immune system's learning process?

## The TIRA Hypothesis

We propose using a engineered, replication-incompetent viral vector (based on a modified, benign backbone) to deliver synthetic "recognition templates" to dendritic cells *in vivo*. These templates aren't single antigens. Instead, they're designed molecular profiles that correspond to shared metabolic, stress, and mutation-associated signatures common across many cancer types.

Think of it as giving the immune system a broader "search query" instead of a single "wanted poster."

## Proposed Mechanism

1.  **Delivery:** Administered locally, the vector preferentially transfects dendritic cells in the tissue microenvironment.
2.  **Template Presentation:** Dendritic cells process and present the template-derived profile via MHC-I and MHC-II.
3.  **Amplified Recognition:** This presentation educates both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells to recognize cells displaying a wide array of signatures associated with malignant transformation, not just one specific protein.
4.  **Systemic Effect:** Educated T-cells then traffic, seeking and engaging tumor cells matching the broader signature profile.

## What the Data Shows (So Far)

In pilot models, this approach led to:
- A measurable shift in T-cell clonality (tracked via TCR sequencing).
- A significant reduction in tumor growth in multiple murine cancer lines.
- A durable memory response preventing re-challenge.
- A notably manageable cytokine profile, suggesting a lower risk of overwhelming immune-related adverse events.

**Crucially,** this has been observed across different cancer models, supporting the "broad recognition" hypothesis.

## The Caveats (Big Ones)

This is a platform concept. The exact template sequences, vector engineering details, dosing, and formulation for human translation are not disclosed here. Those components are proprietary and represent the translational bridge from concept to potential application.

This repository provides everything needed to verify the *immune priming effect* and the *anti-tumor activity* in a research setting. It does not provide the means to develop a clinical product.
